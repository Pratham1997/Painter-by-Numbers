# Painter-by-Numbers
descriptionThe aim of this project is to develop a model which can identify the authenticity of a painting. We predict the painter of a given painting from our database of famous painters. This can help in the identification of original and forged paintings. The results are obtained for both the standard CNN model, and a novel approach of Hierarchical CNN.
